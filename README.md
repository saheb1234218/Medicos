this is a smart machine which has the feature to help victims with different diseases ,helping them knowing the prescribed medicines without going to doctors.
I have designed it using Arduino UNO R3 with a bluetooth module HC05 and a speaker.
The bluetooth module pairs up with the android phone of the customer and when the customer speaks it takes that input and converts to a text and finds the precribed medicines for that disease, then converts the text to speech and outputs it to the customer as voice
